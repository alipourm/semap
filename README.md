Software Engineering Research Map
=====================================

This project aims to extract and visualize the relation between software engineering researchers. 
This can be used to guage diversity, pioneers and hot topics in the field.  
For thi, we use [ACM Digital Library] (http://dl.acm.org) 
to extract papers presented in major SE conferences such as ICSE, FSE, ASE, ISSTA and ESEM.
